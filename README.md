Simple website constructed during the <a href="https://lp.rocketseat.com.br/nlw">Rocketseat's "Next Level Week #8"</a> in September 2022. <a href="https://lknknm.github.io/nlw-explorer/"> Click here to see it!</a>

The website was constructed based on a Figma template shared by Rocketseat. We then learned basic HTML + CSS concepts around the original template. After that, we're allowed to make some small changes customizing it to our own taste. Finally, we used Git + Github to commit the project.
